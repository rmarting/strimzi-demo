  config:
    # When a producer sets acks to "all" (or "-1"), this configuration specifies the minimum
    # number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful. 
    # If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception
    # (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend). When used together, min.insync.replicas
    # and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to
    # create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce
    # with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception\
    # if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.
    min.insync.replicas: "2"
    # This configuration controls the maximum time we will retain a log before we
    # will discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the "delete"
    # retention policy. This represents an SLA on how soon consumers must read
    # their data. If set to -1, no time limit is applied.
    # Value: 2 hours
    retention.ms: 7200000
    # This configuration controls the segment file size for the log. Retention and
    # cleaning is always done a file at a time so a larger segment size means fewer
    # files but less granular control over retention.
    # Value: 1Gb
